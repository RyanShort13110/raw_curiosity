            Curiosity is a car-sized Mars rover designed to explore the Gale
            crater on Mars as part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory
            mission. Curiosity was launched from Cape Canaveral on November 26,
            2011, at 15:02:00 UTC and landed on Aeolis Palus inside Gale crater
            on Mars on August 6, 2012, 05:17:57 UTC. The Bradbury Landing site
            was less than 2.4 km from the center of the rover's touchdown target
            after a 560 million km journey. Mission goals include an
            investigation of the Martian climate and geology, assessment of
            whether the selected field site inside Gale has ever offered
            environmental conditions favorable for microbial life, and planetary
            habitability studies in preparation for human exploration. In
            December 2012, Curiosity's two-year mission was extended
            indefinitely, and on August 5, 2017, NASA celebrated the fifth
            anniversary of the Curiosity rover landing.

            Opportunity, also known as MER-B or MER-1, is a robotic rover that
            was active on Mars from 2004 until 2018. Opportunity was operational
            on Mars for 5111 sols. Launched on July 7, 2003, as part of NASA's
            Mars Exploration Rover program, it landed in Meridiani Planum on
            January 25, 2004, three weeks after its twin, Spirit, touched down
            on the other side of the planet. With a planned 90-sol duration of
            activity, Spirit functioned until it got stuck in 2009 and ceased
            communications in 2010, while Opportunity was able to stay
            operational for 5111 sols after landing, maintaining its power and
            key systems through continual recharging of its batteries using
            solar power, and hibernating during events such as dust storms to
            save power. This careful operation allowed Opportunity to operate
            for 57 times its designed lifespan, exceeding the initial plan by 14
            years, 47 days. By June 10, 2018, when it last contacted NASA, the
            rover had traveled a distance of 45.16 kilometers.

            Spirit, also known as MER-A or MER-2, is a Mars robotic rover,
            active from 2004 to 2010. Spirit was operational on Mars for 2208
            sols or 3.3 Martian years. It was one of two rovers of NASA's Mars
            Exploration Rover Mission managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
            Spirit landed successfully within the impact crater Gusev on Mars at
            04:35 Ground UTC on January 4, 2004, three weeks before its twin,
            Opportunity, which landed on the other side of the planet. Its name
            was chosen through a NASA-sponsored student essay competition. The
            rover got stuck in a "sand trap" in late 2009 at an angle that
            hampered recharging of its batteries; its last communication with
            Earth was on March 22, 2010. The rover completed its planned 90-sol
            mission. Aided by cleaning events that resulted in more energy from
            its solar panels, Spirit went on to function effectively over twenty
            times longer than NASA planners expected.
